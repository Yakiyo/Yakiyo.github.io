# Yakiyo's Portfolio

My portfolio source code. Simple thing cause I don't know enough css.

### CSS
I'm using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. From the command line, use the [tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to generate [`styles.css`](./styles.css)

```bash
$ tailwindcss -o styles.css
```

If you liked my portfolio, hope you drop a star. Thanks for visiting! ðŸŒŸ
